## Prerequisites

Program is made for UNIX operating systems. C11 (or later) is used for the implementation. Implementation uses standard socket and networking libraries (sys/socket.h, arpa/inet.h, netinet/in.h).

## Installation

To compile sender and receiver, run this command in the console in the root directory:

```constole
make
```

| first positional  | [BASE_HOST]       | base hostname domain                    | NOT OPTIONAL                     |
| second positional | [DST_FILENAME]    | name under which to store the sent file | NOT OPTIONAL                     |
| third positional  | [SRC_FILEPATH]    | path to the sent file                   | standard input                   |

## Receiver parameters

| Parameter         | Argument      | Description                                    | Default value |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |

| first positional  | [BASE_HOST]   | base hostname domain                           | NOT OPTIONAL  |
| second positional | [DST_DIRPATH] | directory into which received files are stored | NOT OPTIONAL  |

## Example usage of sender

**Send 'test.txt' file under name 'mytext.txt' to the server on the loopback (base hostname random.com)**

```console
./dns_sender -u 127.0.0.1 random.com mytext.txt test.txt
```

**Send data from stdin under name 'mytext.txt' to the default dns server (base hostname random.com)**

```console
./dns_sender random.com mytext.txt
```

## Example usage of receiver

**Start receiver server (base hostname random.com) with directory for received files being named 'received'**

```console
./dns_receiver random.com received
```

**Start receiver server (base hostname random.com) with directory for received files being named 'received'**

```console
./dns_receiver random.com received/
```
